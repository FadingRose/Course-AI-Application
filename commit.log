    Initial commit: Added LaBSE training script

    This commit introduces the initial version of the LaBSE training script. The script includes the following components:

    1. Data download and loading functions for the PAWS-X dataset.
    2. Custom dataset class `PAWSXDataset` for handling the dataset.
    3. Model definition `TextSimilarityModel` using the LaBSE model from Hugging Face.
    4. Training function `train_epoch` for training the model.
    5. Evaluation function `evaluate` for evaluating the model on validation and test sets.
    6. Function `plot_training_history` for visualizing the training and validation loss and accuracy.
    7. Main function `main` to orchestrate the training process, including data loading, model initialization, training loop, and evaluation.

    The script is designed to train a text similarity model using the LaBSE model on the PAWS-X dataset, with support for training, validation, and testing.

    Changes:
    - Added `LaBSE_train.py` script.
